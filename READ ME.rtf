\f0\fs24 \cf0 This is the final project for CIM540 Intro to Creative Coding. This is a simulation for Blackjack betting based on the recent trends of high frequency trading versus the actively managed firms on Wall Street. Alternatively, I can receive the stock information from two companies (say Apple and Microsoft) and run the simulation of their stocks against each other for say 1000 runs (or 1000 hands).}

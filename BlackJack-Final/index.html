      <text>Your money is important to you. Would you rather invest in an actively managed fund which picks stocks and bonds based on market research and intuition, or a passively managed fund (index fund) which picks stocks and bonds in a more conservative fashion based on an index of the market. To demonstrate the change, I've modeled the stock market as a game of Black Jack, in which two computer players, an actively managed fund and an index fund try to beat the house (dealer). 

      Change the slider on the top right to change the framerate from between 1 and 5 frames. May the best fund win!</text>
